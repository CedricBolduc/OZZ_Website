This site, previously known as “’Honest Ed’s” at Bloor and Bathurst Street is a very historic site within the city and spans the entire city block @ 581 Bloor Street West Toronto. A total of 806 rentals units are being built across 6 different buildings on the site, complete with an open outdoor market, retail, office and commercial real estate. 
This will be the first mixed facility of it’s kind with two cogeneration power plants being constructed which will provide energy to the finished complex as well as feeding electricity back into the grid from the high voltage end. The building energy and modelling was designed and engineered by an OZZ affiliated company “EQ Building Performance” and the tenant sub-metering on the project is being provided by another OZZ affiliated company “Provident Energy Management” and installed by OZZ Electric.
