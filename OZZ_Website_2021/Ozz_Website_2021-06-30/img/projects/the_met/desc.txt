Located in Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, the Met Condos is a new 35-storey tower featuring 530 condominium suites and 62 townhome units developed by Plaza.

Commonly known as VMC, Vaughan Metropolitan Centre has grown to become a major commercial and residential hub. With direct subway access to Downtown Toronto, a major regional bus hub in the vicinity and a wealth of retail amenities all just minutes away, the living experience offered in this community is second to none.
OZZ partnered with Plaza on this exciting new build.
