The Eglinton Crosstown LRT is Toronto’s most significant transit expansion in decades, spanning the entire city across 19.5 kilometres of above and below ground track. When finished, the new line will connect five boroughs via multi-modal stations. 
OZZ is uniquely positioned to meet the demanding schedule requirements due to the experience and hard work of every member of our site staff.  We are proud to continue our contribution to Toronto’s transit infrastructure.
