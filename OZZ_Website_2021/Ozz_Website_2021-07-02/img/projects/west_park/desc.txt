West Park Healthcare Centre provides rehabilitation services for a variety of conditions, ranging from amputee rehabilitation – which they have the largest centre in Ontario – to Chronic Respiratory disease. Patients admitted to these healthcare programs are given the treatment they need to get back to living normal lives. 
OZZ partnered with EllisDon and Mulvey Banani International Inc. as our design-build partners, OZZ Electric has made company history as this is the largest project that we have been awarded. The structure itself will be close to one million square feet across six floors, a penthouse and 3 levels of parking garage, housing 314 rehabilitation and complex continuing care inpatient beds and ambulatory care services. Beyond the standard electrical tasks that OZZ Electric is performing, OZZ is exceeding expectations in order to conform to LEEDS standards by implementing environmental initiatives such as Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in the parking garage with contingency for expansion.
